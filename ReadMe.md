The Program Simulates a simple game of Tic Tac Toe, it does not check for winners, only acts as a Board.

In terminal you can type make to compile the program and ./main to run it

from there the program will alternate asking for row and column between the players for 9 turns.
The game can detect if you try to play in the same spot as was already played and will not allow it.
